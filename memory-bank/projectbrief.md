- Use a configurable trigger (e.g., keyboard shortcut) to start and stop recording.
- Process recorded audio for transcription.
- Integrate with a Wyoming server for Speech-to-Text (STT).

- Allow configuration of audio devices, triggers, and other settings via a config file (`config.toml`).

## Project Goals
