# Active Context: LMNOP Transcribe

## Current Work Focus

Recording cancellation feature implemented and refactored.

## Recent Changes

-   Added detailed logging to `src/lmnop_transcribe/trigger_handler.py` to observe all received `evdev` events.
-   Temporarily modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` to bypass audio recording for testing purposes (since reverted).
-   Modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_recorder.py` to use `loop.run_in_executor` for non-blocking file writing (did not resolve the trigger responsiveness issue).
-   Corrected a typo in `src/lmnop_transcribe/config.py` related to loading the keyboard device name.
-   **Resolved Trigger Responsiveness Issue:** The issue where the stop recording trigger was unresponsive during audio recording has been successfully resolved. This was primarily due to `playSound` interacting poorly with reading from the microphone. The start noise was removed as a solution.
-   **Refactored application flow:** Moved post-recording processing (cleanup, transcription, pasting) from `src/lmnop_transcribe/__main__.py` to the main loop within `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py`.
-   **Updated `__main__.py`:** Modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/__main__.py` to simply call and await the `record` function, which now contains the main application loop.
-   **Addressed Pylance error:** Resolved a Pylance error in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` related to the `clippaste` subprocess call using `typing.cast` and a nested function.
-   Added logging for time elapsed during audio recording in `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_recorder.py`.
-   Added timing measurements for external calls (SoX, transcription, clipboard paste) in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py`.
-   Removed all references to the start sound from `config.toml`, `src/lmnop_transcribe/user_feedback.py`, and `src/lmnop_transcribe/config.py`.
-   Implemented recording cancellation feature: Added `wait_for_cancel_trigger` to `trigger_handler.py` and modified `recorder.py` to use `asyncio.wait` for a race between stop and cancel triggers. Refactored `run_recording_cycle` to use `handle_stop` and `handle_cancel` functions.
-   **Replaced Clipboard Paste with ydotool:** Replaced the `wl-copy` and `wl-paste` subprocess calls in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` with a call to `ydotool type` for typing the transcribed text. Used `shlex.quote()` for proper escaping of the text.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   Implemented multiprocessing for audio handling to resolve trigger responsiveness issues.
-   Completed integration with the Wyoming server for Speech-to-Text (STT).
-   Completed the transcription functionality.
-   Completed user feedback mechanisms.
-   **D-Bus for Inter-Application Signaling:** Decided to use D-Bus as the standard mechanism for the `lmnop-transcribe` service to signal its state to other applications.

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   Interactions between different libraries, particularly audio playback (`playSound`) and audio recording, can lead to unexpected conflicts and performance issues.
-   Debugging asynchronous applications requires careful observation of event flow and potential bottlenecks.
-   Multiprocessing is a valuable pattern for isolating potentially problematic operations in Python.
-   The `playSound` function, specifically the execution of `pw-play` within it, was a significant source of event processing delay when run concurrently with audio recording.
-   The fact that `libinput-record` can read events unimpeded while audio is recording suggested the issue was within our application's interaction with audio/event handling, not a system-level conflict.
-   `aiodebug` is a useful tool for monitoring and debugging asyncio event loop performance.
-   Careful handling of types and potential `None` values is necessary when integrating different parts of the codebase, as highlighted by the Pylance error.
-   Removing the start noise in `playSound` resolved the immediate trigger responsiveness issue.

-   Created a systemd user service file (`lmnop-transcribe.service`) for deploying the application as a background service.
-   Created an installation script (`install-service.sh`) to automate the deployment of the service file.
-   Updated the systemd service file's `ExecStart` command based on the `WorkingDirectory` setting.
-   Modified the installation script to stop the service if it's running before updating and starting it.
-   Acknowledged the user's movement of the service file to `/res` and the install script to `/scripts`.
