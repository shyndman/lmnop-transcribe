# Active Context: LMNOP Transcribe

## Current Work Focus

Implementing and refining the streaming audio transcription pipeline.

## Recent Changes

-   **Implemented Immediate Audio Streaming:** Modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` to run the synchronous `transcribe_audio_with_wyoming` function in a thread pool using `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor` concurrently with the audio recording process. This allows audio chunks from the multiprocessing queue to be streamed to the Wyoming server as they are recorded, achieving immediate streaming.
-   **Refactored Handler Functions:** Extracted the common logic for stopping the audio recording process and signaling the queue from `handle_stop` and `handle_cancel` into a new asynchronous helper function `_stop_recording_process` in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py`.
-   **Awaited Concurrent Tasks:** Updated `run_recording_cycle` in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` to use `asyncio.gather` to concurrently await the completion of both the audio recording process and the transcription task after a stop or cancel trigger.
-   **Used Asynchronous Subprocess for Pasting:** Replaced the synchronous `subprocess.run` call in the `paste_transcribed_text` function in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` with `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` for asynchronous execution of the `ydotool` command.
-   **Removed Unnecessary Assignments:** Removed the redundant `audio_process = None` and `stop_event = None` assignments from the `handle_stop` and `handle_cancel` functions in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py`.
-   **Fixed Pylance Type Hinting Errors:** Addressed Pylance errors related to type hinting after using `asyncio.gather` with `return_exceptions=True` by refining the type check before calling `paste_transcribed_text` in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py`.
-   **Removed Dumb Comments:** Reviewed and removed obvious or redundant comments from `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` according to code styling rules.
-   **Removed Unused Function:** Removed the unused `stream_transcribe_audio_with_wyoming` function from `src/lmnop_transcribe/transcriber.py`.
-   **Removed SoX Dependencies:** Removed SoX-related configuration options from `config.toml` and `src/lmnop_transcribe/config.py`. Removed the `cleanup_audio` function from `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_processor.py`. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Refactored Audio Recorder:** Extracted the core processing logic into `_process_incoming_audio` in `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_recorder.py` to improve readability and reduce indentation. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Implemented Buffering and Manual Trimming:** Added logic in `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_recorder.py` to buffer initial audio chunks, manually calculate and trim a configurable duration based on audio parameters, and send the trimmed audio and subsequent chunks via a `multiprocessing.Queue`. File writing has been removed from this process. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Adapted Transcriber for Streaming:** Modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/transcriber.py` to receive audio chunks from a `multiprocessing.Queue` and stream them incrementally to the Wyoming server using the Wyoming protocol. Removed file-based audio reading. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Updated Recorder for Pipeline:** Modified `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` to create and manage the `multiprocessing.Queue`, spawn the audio recording process with the queue, pass the queue to the adapted transcriber, and handle the process lifecycle and stream termination signal (`None` in the queue). (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Cleaned Up Comments (Previous):** Reviewed and removed "dumb comments" (obvious or redundant explanations) from `src/lmnop_transcribe/config.py`, `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_processor.py`, `src/lmnop_transcribe/audio_recorder.py`, `src/lmnop_transcribe/transcriber.py`, and `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` according to code styling rules. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)
-   **Corrected Type Hinting (Previous):** Addressed Pylance errors related to type hints for `multiprocessing.Queue` in `src/lmnop_transcribe/recorder.py` and removed incorrect variable reassignments. (Keeping previous relevant changes for context)


## Active Decisions and Considerations

-   **Streaming Pipeline Implementation:** Decided to implement immediate audio streaming by running the existing synchronous transcription function (`transcribe_audio_with_wyoming`) in a thread pool using `asyncio.get_event_loop().run_in_executor` concurrently with the audio recording process, leveraging the existing queue-based communication. This approach was chosen over creating a new asynchronous streaming function to simplify implementation given the existing components.
-   **Error Handling with `asyncio.gather`:** Used `return_exceptions=True` with `asyncio.gather` to prevent cancellation of other tasks if one fails and implemented checks for exceptions in the results.
-   **Pylance Type Hinting:** Addressed Pylance's static analysis limitations with union types from `asyncio.gather` by adding explicit type checks before using variables.
-   **Streaming Pipeline:** Decided to move from a file-based audio processing approach to a streaming pipeline using `multiprocessing.Queue` for better efficiency and responsiveness. (Keeping previous relevant decisions for context)
-   **Manual Trimming:** Opted for manual trimming of initial audio bytes based on configuration and audio parameters instead of using external tools like SoX or libraries like pysox to reduce dependencies and simplify the process. (Keeping previous relevant decisions for context)
-   **Inter-Process Communication:** Confirmed `multiprocessing.Queue` as the mechanism for transferring audio data between the recording and main processes. (Keeping previous relevant decisions for context)
-   **End of Stream Signal:** Decided to use `None` as a sentinel value put onto the audio queue by the recording process to signal the end of the audio stream to the transcriber. (Keeping previous relevant decisions for context)
-   **Pylance Errors in Standard Library:** Acknowledged remaining Pylance errors in `multiprocessing/queues.py` as likely static analysis issues rather than bugs in the project code. (Keeping previous relevant decisions for context)

## Learnings and Project Insights

-   Implementing concurrent tasks with `asyncio` and `multiprocessing` requires careful management of process lifecycles, inter-process communication, and task completion/cancellation.
-   Using `asyncio.gather` with `return_exceptions=True` is a useful pattern for awaiting multiple concurrent tasks while handling potential failures gracefully, although it can introduce complexity in type hinting and static analysis.
-   Explicit type checks (`isinstance`) can be necessary to help static analysis tools like Pylance correctly infer types when dealing with complex union types resulting from asynchronous operations.
-   Refactoring for concurrency and streaming can significantly change the application's flow and require adjustments to how different components interact and how results are handled.
-   Implementing significant architectural changes (like moving to a streaming pipeline) requires careful planning and iterative development, often revealing unforeseen challenges (e.g., adapting existing code, handling inter-process communication nuances). (Keeping previous relevant learnings for context)
-   Debugging issues related to multiprocessing and asynchronous programming requires close attention to process lifecycles, shared resources, and signaling mechanisms. (Keeping previous relevant learnings for context)
-   The `replace_in_file` tool can be challenging for complex code modifications, sometimes requiring fallback to `write_to_file` for extensive changes. (Keeping previous relevant learnings for context)
-   Explicit and accurate type hinting, especially with libraries like `multiprocessing` and `aiomultiprocess`, is crucial for catching potential issues early and improving code clarity, although static analysis tools may sometimes struggle with complex interactions. (Keeping previous relevant learnings for context)
-   Adhering to code styling rules, such as avoiding "dumb comments" and initializing variables where used, contributes to a cleaner and more maintainable codebase. (Keeping previous relevant learnings for context)

## Pending Tasks and Next Steps

- Implement automatic recording cancellation based on duration threshold (re-evaluate how this fits with the streaming approach).
- Add user feedback for cancelled recordings.
- Refine error handling and edge case management in the streaming pipeline (e.g., what happens if the Wyoming server disconnects mid-stream).
- Re-evaluate the minimum recording duration check and decide where it should be implemented in the new pipeline.
